    <head>HELLO!</head>
    <body>
        <p>My name is <strong>Drew Hersch </strong>, a senior at <i>CU Boulder</i>. I have always had a strong passion for creativity. Across the realms of photography, musical theatre, film, songwriting, music production, design, and creative direction, creativity has fueled the first 20 years of my life. I am now working in Visual Media at Anthem Branding, photographing merch and enjoying a fantastic company culture!</p>
        <a href="img/AfterlightImage.jpeg">Here's a photo of me!   </a> 
        <p>A fun fact about me is I watch music videos & live performances on YouTube like other people watch movies and TV shows. You'll rarely ever be at my house without a music video on. 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s37x2VSZrLw">The best live performance to ever exist!</a>
