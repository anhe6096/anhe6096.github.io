    <p>1 studio album, 1 EP, 11 singles. Visual branding work for Aeropostale, Camelbak, Chipotle and Coca Cola. Photography for Mads Lewis, Ben Azelart, Ricky Dillon, Madilyn Bailey. Over 25 stage performances. This is only the beginning of my creative journey.</p>

    <p>I have always had a strong passion for creativity. Across the realms of photography, musical theatre, film, songwriting, music production, design, and creative direction, creativity has fueled the first 20 years of my life.</p>
        
    <p>After saving up for my first camera in 2015, I immediately fell in love with the concept of capturing time. By 16 years old, I had turned this passion into a business - having built up a list of clients that boasted collaborations with Aeropostale, Coca Cola, Tilly’s, and UGGs. Not yet able to drive, I spent years consistently commuting all around Orange County and up to Los Angeles via train, to shoot everything from family holiday cards to fashion portraits for an upcoming winter collection. </p>
        
    <p>I am eager to progress into this industry as an artist of multiple mediums. After falling in love with songwriting and music production in 2017, I went on to develop a catalog of music that combines alternative pop with all of the theatricality that I grew up on. Past experience in photography, film, and technical design have led me to put myself in charge of nearly every behind-the-scenes aspect of my own musical projects - cover art, music video direction/editing, promo design, etc. My highly mobile director’s chair has secured me a believer that good art can be created anywhere. At 17 years old, I recorded and produced my most popular track, "honey", on Garageband using only a dirt-cheap microphone and a pair of earbuds. The 2019 track has since earned over 750,000 streams and now stands as evidence that nothing is more important than being innovative.</p>
        
    <p>I am now working in Visual Media at Anthem Branding, taking freelance bookings and performing my music on the side.</p>
